# Scenario-Based Interview Questions For Java Developers

## Core Java (General Questions)

- Explain how you would handle a scenario where a method needs to be thread-safe but also efficient.

  **Answer:**
  To make a method both thread-safe and efficient:

  1. **Minimize Lock Scope:** Only synchronize the critical section (the part that modifies shared state), not the entire method. This reduces contention and improves performance.
  2. **Use Modern Concurrency Utilities:** Prefer `java.util.concurrent` classes like `ReentrantLock`, `AtomicInteger`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, etc., which are designed for high concurrency and better performance than traditional synchronization.
  3. **Leverage Immutability:** If possible, design your objects to be immutable. Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe and require no synchronization.
  4. **Double-Checked Locking:** For expensive initialization (like singletons), use double-checked locking with a `volatile` variable to reduce synchronization overhead.
  5. **Read/Write Locks:** If your method is read-heavy, use `ReadWriteLock` to allow multiple threads to read simultaneously while still synchronizing writes.

  **Example 1: Using Atomic Variables**
  ```java
  private final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

  public int increment() {
      return counter.incrementAndGet(); // Thread-safe and efficient
  }
  ```

  **Example 2: Using Synchronized Block (minimized scope)**
  ```java
  private final Object lock = new Object();
  private int value;

  public void updateValue(int newValue) {
      // Only synchronize the critical section
      synchronized (lock) {
          value = newValue;
      }
  }
  ```

  **Example 3: Using Concurrent Collections**
  ```java
  private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

  public void putValue(String key, Integer value) {
      map.put(key, value); // Thread-safe and efficient
  }
  ```

  **Summary Table:**

  | Approach                        | Thread-Safe | Efficient | Use Case                        |
  |----------------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
  | Synchronized method/block        | Yes         | Sometimes | Simple critical sections         |
  | Atomic variables                 | Yes         | Yes       | Counters, flags                  |
  | Concurrent collections           | Yes         | Yes       | Shared maps, sets, queues        |
  | ReadWriteLock                    | Yes         | Yes       | Read-heavy scenarios             |
  | Immutability                     | Yes         | Yes       | Data that doesn't change         |
