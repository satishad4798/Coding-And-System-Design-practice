Static block, instance block, constructor, methods — execution flow
Rules:

Static blocks → executed once when the class is loaded.

Instance initializer blocks → executed every time an object is created, before constructor.

Constructor → executed after instance block for object initialization.

Instance methods → executed when called on an object.

Static methods → executed when called using class name or reference.
