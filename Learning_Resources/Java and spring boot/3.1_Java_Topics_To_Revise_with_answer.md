# topics to revise before your interview

## Core Java

- **Internal working of `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `TreeSet`**
    - `HashMap` uses a hash table to store key-value pairs. It computes a hash code for the key and uses it to determine
      the bucket location. Collisions are handled using a linked list or a balanced tree (since Java 8). `HashSet` is
      backed by a `HashMap` and stores only keys (values are dummy). `TreeSet` is backed by a `TreeMap` and stores
      elements in a sorted (natural or custom) order using a Red-Black tree.
    - Example:
      ```java
      HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
      map.put("a", 1);
      HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
      set.add("a");
      TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
      treeSet.add(5);
      ```

- **`Comparable` vs `Comparator`**
    - `Comparable` is used to define the natural ordering of objects (by implementing `compareTo`). `Comparator` is used
      to define custom orderings (by implementing `compare`).
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
        int age;
        public int compareTo(Person o) { return this.age - o.age; }
      }
      Comparator<Person> byName = Comparator.comparing(p -> p.name);
      ```

- **Collections utility classes (`Collections`, `Arrays`, etc.)**
    - `Collections` provides static methods for collection operations (sorting, searching, synchronization, etc.).
      `Arrays` provides similar utilities for arrays.
    - Example:
      ```java
      List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(3, 1, 2);
      Collections.sort(list);
      int[] arr = {3, 1, 2};
      Arrays.sort(arr);
      ```

- **Fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators**
    - Fail-fast iterators (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is
      modified during iteration. Fail-safe iterators (e.g., `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap`) work on a clone
      and do not throw exceptions.

- **Java 8 Features**
    - Major features: Lambda expressions, Stream API, Functional interfaces, Default and static methods in interfaces,
      Optional, new Date/Time API, CompletableFuture, and more.

- **Stream API**
    - Provides a declarative way to process collections (filter, map, reduce, collect, etc.). Supports parallel
      processing.
    - Example:
      ```java
      List<String> names = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
      names.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("a")).forEach(System.out::println);
      ```

- **Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces**
    - Lambda: `(params) -> expression`. Functional interface: interface with a single abstract method (e.g., Runnable,
      Comparator).
    - Example:
      ```java
      Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
      ```

- **Multithreading and Lock Strategies**
    - Use `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, or higher-level concurrency utilities. Prefer fine-grained locking and
      concurrent collections for scalability.

- **String Class**
    - Immutable, stored in the string pool. Use `StringBuilder` for concatenation in loops.

- **Static Keyword (blocks, classes, variables)**
    - `static` means class-level. Static blocks run once when the class is loaded. Static variables are shared. Static
      methods belong to the class.

- **Global and Instance Variables**
    - Global (static) variables are shared across all instances. Instance variables are unique to each object.

- **Java Memory Model**
    - Defines how threads interact through memory. Key concepts: heap, stack, visibility, atomicity, happens-before.

- **Collections (All, HashMap - synchronized and other types)**
    - Use `Collections.synchronizedMap`, `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread safety. Prefer concurrent collections for high
      concurrency.

- **Using model classes as keys in HashMap or Set**
    - Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` for correct behavior.

- **Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)**
    - Singleton: one instance. Factory: object creation. Observer: event notification. Know intent, structure, and use
      cases.

- **SOLID Principles**
    - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion. Write
      maintainable, extensible code.

- **Java Version Usage and Java 8 Differences**
    - Java 8 introduced lambdas, streams, default methods, new Date/Time API. Know what changed from previous versions.

- **Abstract Class and Functional Interfaces (example-based questions)**
    - Abstract class: can have state, multiple methods. Functional interface: single abstract method, used for lambdas.

- **Try-Catch-Finally (detailed)**
    - `finally` always runs. Use try-with-resources for auto-closing. Catch specific exceptions first.

- **Main Function Miscellaneous Questions**
    - `public static void main(String[] args)`. Entry point. Can overload but JVM calls the standard signature.

- **Operator Precedence**
    - Know order of operations (e.g., *, / before +, -).

- **Constructor Chaining**
    - Use `this()` to call another constructor in the same class, `super()` for parent class constructor.

### Generics

- **Wildcards (`? extends`, `? super`)**
    - `? extends T` is an upper-bounded wildcard (accepts T or its subclasses, used for reading). `? super T` is a
      lower-bounded wildcard (accepts T or its superclasses, used for writing).
    - Example:
      ```java
      List<? extends Number> nums = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // can read as Number
      List<? super Integer> ints = new ArrayList<Number>(); // can write Integer
      ```
- **Bounded and unbounded types**
    - Bounded: restricts the type parameter (e.g., `<T extends Number>`). Unbounded: no restriction (`<T>`).
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Box<T extends Number> {}
      class AnyBox<T> {}
      ```
- **Generic methods and classes**
    - Methods or classes that operate on type parameters. Enables type safety and code reuse.
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Util {
        public static <T> void print(T t) { System.out.println(t); }
      }
      ```

### Stream API (Advanced)

- **Introduction to streams and functional programming in Java**
    - coding.StreamsExampleUsage provide a declarative way to process data. Functional programming emphasizes immutability and
      stateless operations.
- **Intermediate and terminal operations (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`)**
    - Intermediate: `filter`, `map`, `sorted` (return a stream). Terminal: `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce` (produce a
      result or side-effect).
    - Example:
      ```java
      List<String> filtered = list.stream().filter(s -> s.length() > 3).collect(Collectors.toList());
      ```
- **`Optional` class and its usage**
    - `Optional` is a container for nullable values, helps avoid `NullPointerException`.
    - Example:
      ```java
      Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(getName());
      name.ifPresent(System.out::println);
      ```
- **Deep dive into stream parallelism**
    - Use `.parallelStream()` for parallel processing. Suitable for CPU-bound, stateless, non-order-dependent tasks.
      Profile before using.
- **Advanced usage of Collectors and custom collectors**
    - Use `Collectors.groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, or create custom collectors for complex aggregations.
- **Reactive programming with Java**
    - Asynchronous, event-driven programming (e.g., using Project Reactor, RxJava). Useful for handling streams of
      data/events.

### Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces (Advanced)

- **`Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Predicate` interfaces**
    - Built-in functional interfaces for common lambda use cases.
        - `Function<T,R>`: takes T, returns R
        - `Consumer<T>`: takes T, returns void
        - `Supplier<T>`: takes nothing, returns T
        - `Predicate<T>`: takes T, returns boolean
    - Example:
      ```java
      Function<String, Integer> len = String::length;
      Predicate<Integer> isEven = x -> x % 2 == 0;
      Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;
      Supplier<Double> random = Math::random;
      ```
- **Method references and constructor references**
    - Shorthand for lambdas that call a method/constructor. Syntax: `Class::method` or `Class::new`.
    - Example:
      ```java
      list.forEach(System.out::println);
      Stream.generate(String::new);
      ```
