# LLD for Interview

# Basics

- **Class** : blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object** : instance of a class.
- **Interface** :  contract for classes to follow.
    - Defines a contract that implementing classes must follow.
    - Cannot have instance variables (only public static final constants).
    - All methods are implicitly public and abstract (unless they have a default or static implementation).
    - Supports multiple inheritance, unlike classes
