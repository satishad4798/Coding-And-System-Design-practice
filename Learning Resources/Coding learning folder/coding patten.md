# Approach To Solve
- Given a problem here are some questions that should help you figure out the general direction of how to solve it

1. Which data structure can I use? Arrays, LinkedList, HashMap, Heap, Tree, or Trie
2. Do I need to use 2 data structures? eg: LRU
3. How do I break the problem into smaller units, is there a problem within a problem, can i write a decision tree?
4. Does this problem look similar to other problems you have solved?
5. Will sorting make the problem easier to solve?
6. Can I use any algorithmic techniques, like bfs, dfs, two pointer etc.
7. Do any design patterns apply that could make it easier to maintain, like observer pattern?
8. What is the time & space complexity? Best case, worst case time complexity? Average case is usually difficult to derive.


# Coding patterns

1. Pattern: Two Pointers
-  This method uses two pointers to traverse an array or a list from `different ends or directions`.

3. Pattern: Fast & Slow Pointers
- two pointers move at` different speeds` in a data structure

4. Pattern: Sliding Window
- creating a ‘window’ into the data structure and then moving that window around to gather specific information.

5. Pattern: Merge Intervals

1. Prefix Sum

# Algorithm
