Key Topics:
- Dependency Injection, AOP, Profiles
- Spring Boot Starters, Actuator
- RESTful APIs, Exception Handling, Validation
- Spring Security (OAuth2, JWT, RBAC)
- Spring Data JPA & Transactions


3. System Design & Scalability
Topics to Cover:
- Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture
- Database Scaling (Sharding, Replication, Caching)
- API Gateway, Load Balancing
- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Distributed Systems & CAP Theorem

4. SQL & NoSQL Databases
Key Concepts:
- ACID vs BASE Transactions
- Indexing, Query Optimization
- ORM vs Native Queries

7. Behavioral and Soft Skills
Common Questions:
- "Tell me about a time you faced a technical challenge and how you solved it."
- "How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure?"
- "Describe a situation where you mentored a junior developer."
